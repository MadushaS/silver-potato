This event is made possible through the generous partnership of **WSO2**, who not only sponsored the Open-Source Summit ‚Äò24 but are now hosting this follow-up event at their Colombo headquarters. Their commitment to supporting the open-source community has been pivotal, and we are excited to continue this collaboration for the Post-Summit Meetup.
